# üõ∫"Tuk Tuk To the Moon"
a decentralized patreon for creators and communities to fund what they love, together
Like Carpool with Tuk Tuk, we could create on-chain pool to fundraise and crowdsource for data contributions and reward creators trustlessly.


## Why
Creator platforms like Patreon today are far from perfect

1. Trust concern -- phishing and scams.
2. 

We could learn from platforms like Gitcoin, Giveth etc
‚ùìWhat if we support creators to join force and mobilize their community to create fundraising campaign. 
‚ùìWhat if we enable trustless reward for contributions
‚ùìWhat if we bring reputation systems on-chain

We have ETH - Let's bring Economy, Trust, Human on-chain 

## Features

- Mint ENS L2 name 
- Show followers Ethereum Follower Protocol to indicate reputation
- Create Akave Bucket to crowdsource data and art, then track for reward
- Drag-and-drop to setup funding target


## How it's build
- For each pool, we will 
 - create Akave for community to upload data and media
 - deploy L2 registrar so we can rereceive funding directly
