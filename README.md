# üõ∫"Tuk Tuk To the Moon"
Decentralized patreon for creators and communities to fund what they love, together
Like Carpool with Tuk Tuk, we could create on-chain pool to fundraise and crowdsource for data contributions and reward creators trustlessly.


## Why
Creator platforms like Patreon today are far from perfect

1. Trust concern -- phishing and scams.
2. middleman - 8% fees + 3% to credit card
3. no mechanisms to incentivize (e.g. airdrop) community to contribute  
4. attention - easier to run rounds over creator fundraise indiviudally 

We could learn from platforms like Gitcoin, Giveth etc
‚ùìWhat if we support creators to join force and mobilize their community to create fundraising campaign. 
‚ùìWhat if we enable trustless reward for contributions
‚ùìWhat if we bring reputation systems on-chain

We have ETH - Let's bring Economy, Trust, Human on-chain 

## Features

- Mint ENS L2 name to receive funding
- Allow community to follow with Ethereum Follower Protocol to indicate reputation
- Create Akave Bucket to crowdsource data and art, then track for reward
- Drag-and-drop to setup funding target and disperse

## Use cases
- crowdsourcing for music creation e.g. Ethereum unofficial theme song
- crowdsourcing for deSci e.g. Collect air quality sensors
- crowdfunding in charity run

## How it's build
- With UI it's possible to connect and create a pool, where the app will 
 - create Akave for community to upload data and media
 - deploy L2 registrar so we can rereceive funding directly
 - update the bucket onto L2 subname TXT record 
 - create a Coinbase smart account as the owner of L2 ENS subname
   - where the smart account could be owned by either pool manager / Chianlink Gatekeeper   
 - with the metadata on akave, we can verify contributors and split reward to legit address
 - we could extend this by updating L2 TXT records on ENS subname to include verified contributors, and pre-configure smart account to disperse in trustless mechanisms
