# 🛺"Tuk Tuk To the Moon"
a decentralized patreon for creators and communities to fund what they love, together
Like Carpool with Tuk Tuk, we could create on-chain pool to fundraise and crowdsource for data contributions and reward creators trustlessly.


## Why
Creator platforms like Patreon today are far from perfect

1. Trust concern -- phishing and scams.
2. 

We could learn from platforms like Gitcoin, Giveth etc
❓What if we support creators to join force and mobilize their community to create fundraising campaign. 
❓What if we enable trustless reward for contributions
❓What if we bring reputation systems on-chain

We have ETH - Let's bring Economy, Trust, Human on-chain 

## Features

- Drag-and-drop to setup funding target
- Mint ENS L2 name 
- Show followers Ethereum Follower Protocol to indicate reputation
- Create Akave Bucket to crowdsource data and art, then track for reward

## How it's build
- For each pool, we will 
 - create Akave for community to upload data and media
 - deploy L2 registrar so we can rereceive funding directly
